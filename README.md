# SHORTEST PATH FINDER

Implemented BFS (Breadth First Search)
algorithm to find shortest path between given points (source to destination).


## Appendix
I used window-curses module to override console output. 
I have mentioned the link for this module documentation(PyPI).

#### Breadth First Search [BFS] :
Breadth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts 
traversing the graph from the root node and explores all the 
neighboring nodes. Then, it selects the nearest node and explores 
all the unexplored nodes. 

It is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices 
of a tree or graph data structure. BFS puts every vertex of the 
graph into two categories, visited and non-visited. 
It selects a single node in a graph and, after that, visits 
all the nodes adjacent to the selected node. 
It uses 'Queue' data structure

#### data structure used [Queue]:

  - A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables insert operations to be performed at one end called REAR and delete operations to be performed at another end called FRONT.

  - Queue is referred to be as First In First Out list.

  - For example, people waiting in line for a rail ticket form a queue.
### Modules 

 - Curses
 - Wrapper
 - Queue 
 - Time
#### Installation

Install 'curses' module (for windows)
```bash
  pip install windows-curses
```
    
#### Documentation:
Documentation of module/library window-curses available on 

[window-curses.PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/)

Github repo is also mentioned in this documentation.


## Lessons Learned
**Intermediate level project**

Gets to know how to implement an algorithm in projects {BFS}.

How the data structure 'Queue' works.

How to use modules such as windows-curses to override the texts in the console.
